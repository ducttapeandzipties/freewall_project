*Description*
####A "free wall" allowing users to post content and auto archival of previous content.

This app will give users a text input field to input content which will be displayed on the document.  Upon visiting, the app will read the last user's input and display it in a div.  When the user submits input, this will replace the content of the div, write their content to the database, and add their submission to the index.
